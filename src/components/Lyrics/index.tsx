    <p className={styles.body}>
        There is a house in New Orleans
        They call the Rising Sun
        And it&apos;s been the ruin of many a poor boy
        And God, I know I&apos;m one

        My mother was a tailor
        She sewed my new blue jeans
        My father was a gamblin&apos; man
        Down in New Orleans

        Now the only thing a gambler needs
        Is a suitcase and a trunk
        And the only time he&apos;s satisfied
        Is when he&apos;s all drunk
    </p>
